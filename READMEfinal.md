# Week 40
-- I have completed most of tasks from tuesday and wednesday. Thus I have avoided the harder tasks since it is now 3 am sunday morning and i'm ripping my hair out.

-- The tasks for this week was insane so no, thursday and friday wasnt completed. Guess you can subtract that from my studypoints, if it matters so much.
